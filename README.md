<h1 align="center" id="title">OrthoLens</h1>

<p id="description">OrthoLens is a Python-based project designed to facilitate orthographic image processing and analysis. It provides tools for generating orthographic projections performing image transformations and analyzing geometric properties.</p>

  
  
<h2>Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Orthographic Projection Generation: Create orthographic projections from 3D models or point clouds.
*   Image Transformations: Apply geometric transformations such as scaling rotation and translation.
*   Geometric Analysis: Analyze properties like area perimeter and centroid of projected shapes.
*   Visualization Tools: Visualize projections and transformations using matplotlib and other libraries.
